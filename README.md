# 13_ORM_E-Commerce_Back_End

## Description

The motivation was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code, through configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL2 database.

I learnt about using node js, MySQL, Sequelize, data relationships, promises, seeding databases, using schemas and much more.
